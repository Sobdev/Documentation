## FIRST STEPS

### CREATE A PROJECT
#### Using create-react-app  
[create-react-app Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/)
```bash
mkdir "project-name"
npx create-react-app "project-name"
```
For example:
```bash
npx create-react-app first-project
```
To start the projet just run:
```bash
npm start
```
This command launches a development server and opens your React application in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:3000/.

To stop the server, simply press *Ctrl + C* in the terminal where the server is running.

In case you are using Vite, the command to start the server is:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### BASIC CONCEPTS OF PROJECT STRUCTURE
A typical React project created with create-react-app comes with a certain directory structure. Here is a breakdown of the important folders and files:

#### node_modules
The `node_modules` directory contains all the dependencies and packages installed for your React project. These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file. Whenever you run commands like `npm install react-router-dom` or just `npm i`, the packages get installed or updated in this directory.

#### public Directory
The `public` directory is where static files reside. The most crucial file here is `index.html`, which serves as the main HTML file for your application. Inside this file, you'll find a `<div id="root"></div>`, which is where your React components are rendered.

Here's a bit more detail about some files within the public directory:

- **index.html**: This file is the template HTML file that your React components will be injected into. The `id="root"` div is where the React application mounts, and it is configured in the `src/index.js` file.

- **manifest.json**: This file is primarily used for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). It contains metadata that allows your app to be installed on a user's device like a native app, providing offline capabilities, among other features. [PWAs Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app).

- **Other files**: Files like favicon.ico, robots.txt, and images like logo192.png and logo512.png are also stored in the public directory. These are typically used for setting up branding (e.g., the favicon) and controlling web crawler behavior (e.g., robots.txt).

#### src Folder (Functional Component)
The `src` folder is where the core of your React application resides. The main entry point for your application is `src/index.js`, and the main component that gets rendered is typically `src/App.js`.

Here's a sample `index.js` file, which is the entry point for your React application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```
  - **App.js**: This is the main component of your application. It is rendered by index.js and typically contains other components that make up your       application.


  - **index.css**: This file contains global CSS styles for your application. It is imported into index.js.
  
  - **reportWebVitals.js:** This file is used for measuring the performance of your React app. It's optional and can be configured to log results or send them to an analytics endpoint.
  
  ##### Personal Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - **reportWebVitals.js,** **setupTest.js**, **App.test.js** and the line 5 `index.js`: `import reportWebVitals from  './reportWebVitals'` can be deleted in most cases.
    - From a learning POV you can delete those files and adapt the code to look liks this as a good fresh start point: 
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```


### ‚öõÔ∏è COMPONENTS ‚öõÔ∏è

A component is a _fundamental_ part of a React application. It can be a class or a function and represents a piece of the user interface, such as a button, a header, or even an entire page section.
 - **Reusability**: The main feature of React components is their reusability. Whether it‚Äôs a header, a button, or a navigation bar, components can be used multiple times across your project, which helps in maintaining consistency and reducing code duplication.

#### Component Structure

In React, a component typically includes the following elements:

- **Imports**: The first part of a component usually involves importing necessary resources, such as React itself and other dependencies.

- **Function or Class Definition**: The component can be defined as a function or a class. The function is more common in modern React development, often referred to as a "functional component."

- **Props**: The component function can take `props` (short for properties) as an argument. Props are inputs to the component, allowing you to pass data and event handlers down to the component. 

- **JSX Rendering**: Within the function, the `return` statement renders the JSX (JavaScript XML), which is similar to HTML but allows you to integrate JavaScript logic directly into your markup.

- **Export**: Finally, the component should be exported so it can be reused across different parts of the project. The reusability of components is one of the core advantages of using React, as it promotes modular and maintainable code.


Here is a basic example of a functional component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
      <p>This is a reusable component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

#### How to Create a Component in React
##### Basic Method
1. **Create a New File:** Start by creating a new file for your component. The file name should match the component name and use CamelCase notation. For example, `MyComponent.js`.

2. **Import Dependencies:** In this file, import the necessary dependencies. At a minimum, you'll need to import React: 
```javascript 
import React from "react";
```
3. **Define the Component:**
   Declare a functional component using the const keyword. The component's name should match the file name:
```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
return <p>This is my first component!</p>;
};
```
   **Rendering Multiple Elements:** If your component needs to return multiple elements, you must wrap them in a parent element, such as a `<div></div>` or a React Fragment `<> </>`. This is necessary because React components can only return a single element.
```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is my first component!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

   **Choosing the Wrapper:** In most cases, using a `<div></div>` is preferable because it creates a new level of scope. This provides better control over styling and allows the component to function independently, especially when reused multiple times in different parts of your application.
4. **Export the Component:** To make your component available for use in other parts of your application, you need to export it. This is done with the export default syntax:
```javascript
export default MyComponent;
```
5. **Import the Component:** Now that your component is defined and exported, you can import it into another file where you want to use it, such as App.js:
```javascript
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
```
6. **Render the Component:** Finally, include your component in the JSX of the file where it was imported. You do this by using the component as a self-closing tag:
```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```
